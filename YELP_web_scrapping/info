Use the information on the YELP website and suggest 5 top "breakfast and brunch" restaurants in the Helsinki area. 
Here, top pick restaurans refer to those restaurants that accept credit card payment, with the average price between 8-20â‚¬, 
have at least 5 reviews and are open in the weekend. Use plots to compare the top pick restaurants based on 
their review counts, ratings, prices and distance from the city centre. 

You can use either version 2.x or 3.x of Python for this project.

In your final report you should include the following information:

- A brief description of the problem

- Your Python code used for scrapping, analysing and plotting data

- Data plots
